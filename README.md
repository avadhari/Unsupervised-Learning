# Unsupervised-Learning

Two Unsupervised Learning Algorithm have been used on CIFAR-10 Dataset, K-Means and Auto-Encoders.

1) Kmeans has been implemented from scratch without the use of the sklearn library as part of project requirement.
2) Auto-Encoders which are Neural Network Equivalent for the Unsupervised Learning is used for Reduced Dimension Encoded Images for the clustering.

For Evaluation Metrics Dunn's Index has been used for Cluster Quality Detection.
